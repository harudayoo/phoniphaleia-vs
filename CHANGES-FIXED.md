# ElGamal Removal Fixes and Consolidation

This document summarizes the fixes made to the codebase after removing ElGamal encryption implementation.

## Fixes Made

### Frontend

1. **voteVerificationService.ts**:   - Fixed the TypeScript error where `BigInt` (capital B) was used instead of `bigint` (lowercase b)
   - Fixed the parameter order in `verifyVoteProof` function to match the required interface
   - Updated `verifyVoteProof` to properly fetch the verification key from a path and then use the key object for verification
   - Enhanced error handling for JSON parsing of verification key
   - Added robust validation of verification key structure before use
   - Added additional debug logging for easier troubleshooting
   - Removed unused `VerificationKey` import from snarkjsService
   - Updated the return type from `Promise<any>` to `Promise<unknown>` for better type safety
   - Added missing `validateVoteRules` function to check votes against election rules (one vote per position)
   - Created utility function in `testVerificationKey.ts` to help debug verification key loading issues

2. **vote-verify/page.tsx**:
   - Added enhanced error logging for the ZKP verification process
   - Improved error handling for verification failures 
   - Added detailed console logging to track verification process steps

### Backend

1. **crypto_config_controller.py**:
   - Replaced the original empty file with the fixed version that doesn't use ElGamal
   - The fixed version only uses Paillier with Shamir secret sharing for key generation and distribution

2. **verification_controller.py**:
   - Replaced the missing original with the modified version
   - Removed `ThresholdElGamalService` import
   - Updated `decrypt_vote` method to only use Paillier with Shamir secret sharing
   - Updated `generate_partial_decryption` to work with Shamir shares instead of ElGamal

## Files Consolidated

1. Frontend:
   - The main `voteVerificationService.ts` has been updated with all fixes

2. Backend:
   - `crypto_config_controller.py` is now using the fixed version without ElGamal
   - `verification_controller.py` is now using the modified version without ElGamal

## Next Steps

1. **Test the System**:
   - Verify that vote encryption works correctly using only Paillier
   - Test the complete voting workflow including encryption, decryption, and tallying

2. **Update Tests**:
   - Update any tests that rely on ElGamal to use Paillier instead
   - Mark tests specific to ElGamal as skipped if they can't be updated

3. **Documentation**:
   - Ensure all documentation reflects that the system now uses only Paillier with Shamir secret sharing
   - Update any API documentation that mentions ElGamal encryption
