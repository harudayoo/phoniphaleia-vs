# Voter Count Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented voter_count tracking to accurately monitor active voters participating in elections. The voter_count field now:
- **Increments** when voters pass the access-check page (verified) and are granted access to vote
- **Decrements** when the verification email receipt is sent after voting

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`election_controller.py`)

#### 1. Updated `access_check` method (lines ~471-506)
- Added `grant_access` parameter to control when voter_count should be incremented
- When `grant_access=True`, increments `election.voters_count` and commits to database
- Returns `access_granted: True` and current `voters_count` when access is granted
- Improved error handling with try-catch and rollback on failure

#### 2. Updated `send_vote_receipt` method (lines ~814-890)
- Added voter_count decrement after successful email sending
- Decrements `election.voters_count` when receipt email is successfully sent
- Returns updated `voters_count` in response
- Added database rollback on error

#### 3. Removed voter_count increment from `submit_vote` method (lines ~580-620)
- Removed the old logic that incremented voter_count when votes were submitted
- Now voter_count tracks active voters, not total votes cast
- Participation rate calculation unchanged (still based on actual vote count)

### Frontend Changes (`access-check/page.tsx`)

#### 1. Updated access granting logic (lines ~75-110)
- Replaced direct PUT requests to elections endpoint with backend `access-check` calls
- Uses `grant_access: true` parameter when requesting access
- Handles both queued and non-queued elections properly
- Added proper error handling for access grant failures

#### 2. Updated waitlist notification (lines ~150-170)
- Modified waitlist "proceed to vote" button to use proper access-check endpoint
- Ensures voter_count is incremented when waitlisted voters gain access
- Added async/await and error handling for better reliability

### Test Implementation
Created `test_voter_count_tracking.py` to verify the functionality:
- Tests eligibility checking without incrementing count
- Tests access granting with count increment
- Tests receipt sending with count decrement
- Provides clear success/failure feedback

## Key Benefits

1. **Accurate Active Voter Tracking**: voter_count now represents current active voters, not total votes
2. **Proper Queue Management**: Queued elections can accurately track available slots
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: voter_count decreases when voters complete their voting session
4. **Backend Control**: All voter_count updates go through backend endpoints for consistency
5. **Error Recovery**: Database rollback on failures prevents inconsistent state

## Testing

To test the implementation:

```bash
cd backend
python test_voter_count_tracking.py
```

Make sure to:
1. Have the backend server running
2. Update test_election_id and test_voter_id in the script with valid data
3. Ensure the test voter is eligible for the test election

## Flow Summary

1. **Voter accesses election** → Frontend calls `access-check` for eligibility
2. **Access granted** → Frontend calls `access-check` with `grant_access=true` → Backend increments voter_count
3. **Voter votes** → vote submitted (no voter_count change)
4. **Receipt sent** → Backend decrements voter_count when email is successfully sent
5. **Result**: voter_count accurately reflects current active voters

The implementation ensures that voter_count provides real-time visibility into election participation and supports proper queue management for concurrent voter limits.
