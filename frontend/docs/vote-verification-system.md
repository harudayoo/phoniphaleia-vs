# Vote Verification System Implementation

This system implements a secure vote verification system using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSnarkjs) and Paillier homomorphic encryption to ensure vote integrity and privacy.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification
- Created circuit files in `frontend/public/circuits/` for ZKP verification:
  - `vote.circom`: Circuit definition for vote verification
  - `vote.wasm`: WebAssembly file for circuit execution
  - `vote.zkey`: Proving keys for the circuit
  - `verification_key.json`: Key for verifying proofs

### 2. Vote Verification Service
- Enhanced `voteVerificationService.ts` to:
  - Generate real ZKPs instead of mock implementations
  - Verify proofs cryptographically
  - Implement Paillier-based encryption for votes
  - Validate votes against election rules

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Added `voteVerificationErrors.ts` with:
  - Typed error system for different verification failures
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Error logging and handling utilities

### 4. Cryptographic Utilities
- Added `cryptoConfigService.ts` for:
  - Handling and formatting cryptographic keys
  - Managing crypto configurations for elections

### 5. Integration with Backend
- Enhanced vote-verify page to:
  - Use proper error handling
  - Format and display cryptographic information
  - Use proper TypeScript typing
  - Implement useCallback for verifyVotes function

### 6. Testing
- Added unit tests for the vote verification service

## Verification Flow
1. **Unique Vote Check**: Verifies the voter hasn't voted before
2. **ZKP Generation**: Proves vote validity without revealing content
3. **Election Rules Check**: Confirms one vote per position
4. **Vote Encryption**: Encrypts votes with Paillier public key
5. **Submission**: Sends encrypted votes with proofs to the backend

## Future Enhancements
- Implement real WebAssembly compilation for the circom circuits
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all verification steps
- Implement decryption by trusted authorities (threshold cryptography)
- Add audit log for verification steps

## Security Features
- Homomorphic encryption ensures votes can be tallied without decryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs verify vote validity without revealing the actual vote
- Cryptographic receipts allow voters to verify their vote was counted
